# ParkMe

It is my side project to learn ruby language. ParkMe is a telegram bot that registrering a car in a parking system via telegram, so you don't need to look for a parking terminal.

## Commands

/start - start a bot
/setplate - enter a vehicle registration plate
/park - register a car on a parking
/myplate - show actual vehicle registration plate
/listpark - show the list of available parking
